I don't see myself doing this tomorrow since I'll be sitting my Korean exam the day after (FUCKING KOREAN), I'll just do it tonight.

I changed a bit this time, using two method this time, leart from here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3139645/determining-whether-a-number-is-a-fibonacci-number

the first line of input need to be used to indicate the method been used to check, such as 1 for generator or 2 for formular

wanted to implement a junit test for the effiency test but since the result is obvious(see the webpage above), and i'm famous for my laziness, I'll skip it for now (and possibly forever)
