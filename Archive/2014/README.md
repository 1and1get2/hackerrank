started from Jun 14 2014, finished at, well, I don't know, just started.

Basically, this is what I'll be doing when I got the pulse of playing dota.

##	about rate:
*###	1	those question is so easy that I wish I haven't waste my time on this rather to play some game
*###	2	well, it was okay question, might worth doing, might tought me something 
*###	3	some good questions, might needed some thought but figured out 
*###	4	hard questions, might solved after a big headache or not even solved but not too hard after reading the solution
*###	5	really hard ones, couldn't figure out then and might even still confused even after reading the answer
